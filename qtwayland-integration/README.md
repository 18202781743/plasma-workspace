# plasma shell integration

A temporary fork of the xdg-shell shell integration plugin found at https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtwayland.git/tree/src/plugins/shellintegration/xdg-shell.

Note: this is a porting aid whose main purpose is to help us with porting plasmashell to the layer-shell protocol on wayland. Do not use this shell integration plugin in production.
